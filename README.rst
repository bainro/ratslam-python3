========================
RATSLAM (PYTHON VERSION)
========================

This is a full Ratslam implementation in python. This implementation is based 
on Milford's original implementation [1]_ in matlab, and Christine Lee's python 
implementation [2]_. The original data movies can also be found in [1]_.


Dependences
-----------

The only dependence for this package is Numpy [3]_, thus it does not handle how
to open and manage the movie and image files. For this, I strongly recommend 
the use of OpenCV [4]_.
